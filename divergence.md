| Category | Description | Example perceptual cue / likely interpretation |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Agreement** | All predictions align with the aggregated trend. | “Everyone agrees” → high confidence, low perceived uncertainty. |
| **Polarization** | Predictions split into roughly equal groups above and below the aggregate. | “Experts disagree completely” → low trust, high perceived uncertainty. |
| **Risk of Loss** | Aggregated trend is *up*, but a small minority predict *down* (lower). | “Most say it’ll go up, but a few warn decline” → cautious optimism. |
| **Chance of Gain** | Aggregated trend is *down*, but a small minority predict *up* (higher). | “Most say fall, but a few predict rebound” → hopeful contrarian optimism. |
| **Ambiguous Spread** | Predictions scatter broadly around the aggregate without clear clusters. | “Unclear consensus” → diffuse uncertainty; difficult to interpret direction. |
