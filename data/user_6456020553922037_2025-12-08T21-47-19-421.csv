	                <h3>WHAT IS THIS FORM?</h3>
	                <p>This form is called a Consent Form. It will give you information about the study so you can make an informed decision about participation in this research. We encourage you to take some time to think this over and ask questions now and at any other time. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign this form and you will be given a copy for your records.</p>

	                <h3>WHAT ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY THAT I SHOULD BE AWARE OF?</h3>
	                <ul>
	                    <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
	                    <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
	                    <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
	                    <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
	                </ul>

	                <h3>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH STUDY?</h3>
	                <p>The purpose of our study is to explore the visualization design space so we can understand how people perceive, interpret, and make decisions from visualizations. The results from this study can help us design visualizations and visualization guidelines to help people better communicate and understand data.</p>

	                <h3>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?</h3>
	                <p>Participants in this study must be at least 18 years of age or older and have general familiarity with using web-based systems. Participants currently outside of the U.S. cannot participate in this study (e.g. in the European Union or China).</p>

	                <h3>WHAT COMPENSATION I WILL RECEIVE?</h3>
	                <p>You will receive payment through Prolific worth $12/hour for participating in this study. We expect this study to take less than 20 minutes. Your participation is entirely voluntary. You are free to withdraw at any time, and if you do, you will receive partial payment for your time.</p>

	                <h3>HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?</h3>
	                <p>We expect about 200 people will be in this research study.</p>

	                <h3>WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE?</h3>
	                <p>We will show you several data visualizations or components of a visualization and ask you to perform a visual task with the visualization on a computer screen, such as counting, searching, recognizing, memorizing, or describing the information presented to you. We may also ask you to fill out questionnaires concerning your thoughts regarding the visualization you saw. We expect that you will be in this research study to take between 15 and 60 minutes. We expect this study to be a one-off session and will not contact you regarding the study itself in the future.</p>

	                <h3>WILL BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY HELP ME IN ANY WAY?</h3>
	                <p>You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. The potential benefits to you from participation may include learning about how data visualization research is conducted, and you may learn about issues of current interest in data visualization and psychology.</p>

	                <h3>WHAT ARE MY RISKS OF BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?</h3>
	                <p>Your participation in this study does not involve any risks other than what you would encounter in daily life. In particular, you may experience fatigue or boredom, however, you may take breaks between tasks. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a keyboard. You may withdraw at any time.</p>

	                <h3>HOW WILL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION BE PROTECTED?</h3>
	                <p>We will comply with any applicable laws and regulations regarding confidentiality. To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the Georgia Institute of Technology IRB may review study records. The Office of Human Research Protections may also look at study records.</p>
	                <p>Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. Please be notified that our data privacy policy is based on U.S. regulations. Participants who are out of the U.S. might be excluded due to different data privacy requirements.</p>
	                <p><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> De-identified data from this study will be shared among the GATech research team, as well as the research community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee the anonymity of your personal data.</p>

	                <h3>WILL I BE GIVEN ANY MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR BEING IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?</h3>
	                <p>If you agree to take part in this research study, we will provide compensation. You will be paid in accordance with the stated policies of Amazon Mechanical Turk and/or Prolific.com. Payment will be made upon completion and acceptance of tasks that you have agreed to complete and you will be paid via Mechanical Turk or Prolific.com. If you choose to withdraw from the study, you will not be compensated for your participation.</p>

	                <h3>WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW?</h3>
	                <p>We might be using attention check questions in our surveys. If you miss 2 or more attention check questions, your HIT will not be accepted and you will not be compensated.</p>

	                <h3>WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?</h3>
	                <p>If you have any questions about the content of this research project, you may contact Dr. Cindy Xiong Bearfield at cxiong@gatech.edu, or contact Songwen Hu at shu343@gatech.edu. If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject, you may also contact Georgia Institute of Technology Office of Research Integrity Assurance at IRB@gatech.edu.</p>

	                <h3>WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY YES, BUT I CHANGE MY MIND LATER?</h3>
	                <p>You can decide not to participate in this research or you can start and then decide to leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. To do so, simply exit the experiment. Any data already collected will not be saved.</p>

                <p>This study investigated how different ways of presenting uncertainty in predictions affect trust and decision-making.</p>
                
                <h3>Study Background:</h3>
                <p>You were randomly assigned to one of nine different visualization conditions. The goal is to understand which formats help people make better decisions and maintain appropriate trust in prediction systems.</p>
                
                <p>The air quality data you saw was synthetic (computer-generated) for research purposes.</p>
                
                <h3>Questions?</h3>
                <p>If you have questions about this research, please contact the research team.</p>
                
                <p>Your participation contributes to understanding how to design better prediction visualizations for real-world applications like weather forecasting, financial predictions, and public health data.</p>
